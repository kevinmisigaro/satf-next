      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        The leaders of the world agreed on the universal commitment for
        transforming our world through the Sustainable Development Goals. The
        Agenda 2030 has greater youth prioritization and sets a new course of
        global development by 2030. Tanzania is among 193 countries that agreed
        upon that and pledged to mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty,
        fight inequalities, and tackle climate change.

      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        The platform is geared to mainstream project-based learning with the
        integration of formal schools&apos; science curricula. For instance, the
        transformation of agriculture through the application of science and
        technology.
