        Luhira Primary School is a public school located in Ruvuma region in
        Songea district. The school accommodates students&apos; normal students
        and those with special needs such as vision, hearing impairment and
        albinism.
        <br />

        Currently the school has a total of 1030 pupils out of which 33 pupils
        are of special needs and 50 percent are visually impaired. A total of
        212 beneficiaries graduated from their standard Seven studies in

        <br />
        <br />
        The visually impaired pupils have been attending classes with other
        normal pupils and thus face difficult to catch up in their studies due
        to visual impairment. On 27th February 2019 during the handing over of
        bedding facilities as part of community social responsibility in
        celebrating SATF&apos;s 20th Anniversary, SATF received a request on the need
        for the support of 150 voice recorder so as to enable easy the studying
        environment for these pupils.
        <br />
        <br />
        Therefore, the Trust took initiative to raise fund on behalf of Luhira
        Primary school via the global giving platform. The fundraising period
        lasted from 10th to 28th June,2019 where it was able to raise a total of
        TShs 1,786,004(USD 780). The fund was thus used to purchase a total of 8
        brand new Sony voice recorders-ICD PX 470
        <br />
        <br />
        The 8 voice recorders were handed over to the leadership of Luhira
        Primary School on 21st October,2019 in the presence of beneficiaries and
        teachers from Luhira Primary School.
