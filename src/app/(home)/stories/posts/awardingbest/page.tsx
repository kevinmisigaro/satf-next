        The Trust has a culture of embracing with rewards its beneficiaries who
        showcased exceptional efforts and performed well academically.
        <br />
        <br />
        On 25th January 2020, the Trust organized the College Forum at Mesuma
        Hotel, Dar es Salaam. The Forum brought together and rewarded 40 out of
        54 beneficiaries with brand new computers and branded bags. These
        beneficiaries are the form six leavers under SATF program who excelled
        to various Universities in Tanzania after scoring Div I-III on the 2019
        Form VI National Examination. The Trust also invited 4 other
        beneficiaries (3 university continuing beneficiaries and 1 employed
        beneficiary) to motivate the awardees and made a total of 44
        beneficiaries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Attended by SATF Chief Executive Officer whom they called “Mama” and the
        Chair person for SATF Board (Guest of honour) whom they called “Bibi”,
        the event was interactive giving beneficiaries opportunity of knowing
        each other, being motivated, sharing their “sometimes bitter stories”,
        achievements and the way SATF intervention has changed their lives.

        On behalf of others, Bakari Ngonyani from Ruaha University College in
        Iringa gave a vote of thanks. He said “Being recognized as best
        performers is something that will motivate us to perform better. We have
        a debt to pay to the community we come from. Owning the laptop has been
        our dreams. Laptops will assist us in the learning and reduce the costs
        and time spent on stationeries and internet café. We are grateful for
        the tireless efforts SATF made in supporting us to this level
